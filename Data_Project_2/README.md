# Data Project 2

## Overview
Data Project 2 builds upon the achievements of Data Project 1 to further demonstrate a deepened understanding and enhanced competence in creating and implementing foundational data science systems. These include pipelines, scripts, data transformations, containers, APIs, databases, and cloud services. The project consists of two parts:

- **Data Ingestion & Analysis**: This part involves setting up a system to ingest data from an API every minute, analyze it, and store it in a database, focusing on identifying patterns and changes over time.
- **Discord Bot**: This part involves creating a Discord bot that utilizes data science techniques to interact with data sources or APIs.
