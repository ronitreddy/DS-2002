# Data Project 2

## Overview
Data Project 2 builds upon the achievements of Data Project 1 to further demonstrate a deepened understanding of and enhanced competence in creating and implementing foundational data science systems, including pipelines, scripts, data transformations, containers, APIs, databases, and cloud services. This project consists of two parts, which are expanded upon in the following section.

## Project Components

### Part 1: Data Ingestion & Analysis
- This part of the project setting up a system to ingest data from an API every minute, analyze it, and store it in a database, focusing on identifying patterns and changes over time.
- [README for Part 1](./Part_1/README.md)

### Part 2: Discord Bot
